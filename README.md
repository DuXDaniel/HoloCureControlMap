# HoloCureControlMap
Maps controller inputs to HoloCure inputs, with remappable inputs.

Allows for mapping of HoloCure controls to a controller. Currently only works for wired Xbox One controllers.

HoloCure created by Kay Yu and obtainable at https://kay-yu.itch.io/holocure

Instructions:
1. Run the .exe or .py file (.py will require access to inputs, threading, time, sys, json, math, PyQt5, and pyautogui).
2. Mirror the inputs you have chosen in HoloCure on the GUI for HoloCureControlMap
3. Bind the controls you want for the controller.
  3a. Save the settings if you want. These settings will autoload next time you run HoloCureControlMap (from a .json file).
4. Run the pad control and proceed to play in HoloCure!
